# Accommodation Search

## Technical Coding Test

This project has a simple setup with an api, hooked up to MongoDB and a frontend piece initiated with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Install and run

From the project root:

```
npm install
```

### Run

Once install has finished, you can use the following to run both the API and UI:

```
npm run start
```

### API

To run the API separately, navigate to the `./packages/api` folder

```
$ cd packages/api
```

And run the `api` server with

```
$ npm run dev
```

The API should start at http://localhost:3001

### Client

To run the `client` server separately, navigate to the `./packages/client` folder

```
$ cd ./packages/client
```

And run the `client` with

```
$ npm run start
```

The UI should start at http://localhost:3000

### Database connection & environment variables

By default, the code is set up to start and seed a MongoDB in-memory server, which should be sufficient for the test. The database URL will be logged on startup, and the seed data can be found at ./packages/api/db/seeds.

If this setup does not work for you or if you prefer to use your own MongoDB server, you can create a .env file. In the ./packages/api folder, create a .env file (or rename the existing .env.sample) and fill in the environment variables.

## Task at hand

When the project is up and running, you should see a search-bar on the screen. This one is currently hooked up to the `/hotels` endpoint.
When you type in a partial string that is part of the name of the hotel, it should appear on the screen.
Ie. type in `resort` and you should see some Hotels where the word `resort` is present.

You will also see 2 headings called **"Countries"** and **"Cities"**.

The assignment is to build a performant way to search for Hotels, Cities or Countries.
Partial searches will be fine. Hotels will need to filterable by location as well.
Ie. The search `uni` should render

- Hotels that are located in the United States, United Kingdom or have the word `uni` in the hotel name.
- Countries that have `uni` in their name Ie. United States, United Kingdom
- No Cities as there is no match

Clicking the close button within the search field should clear out the field and results.

When clicking on one of the `Hotels`, `Cities` or `Countries` links, the application should redirect to the relevant page and render the selected `Hotel`, `City` or `Country` as a heading.

### Write-up

<!-- Write-up/conclusion section -->

#### Client

- Removed the initial client side filtering logic and moved to server
- Used React Router to support navigation to Hotel, City and Country page
- Used React Query to simplify fetching/loading logic and UI
- Added a debounce hook to the search to prevent excessive search request rate

#### API

- Moved the connection to MongoDB outside of the request handler(s)
- Added 3 more endpoints to retrieve Hotel, City and Country
- Parallelised the 3 search queries in the /search endpoint
- Added a single field index to the searched fields
